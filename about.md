## About
<hr/>
Hi, I'm Greg. This site is an outlet for me to write about stuff I'm working on or things I find interesting. Welcome. You may, or may not find some or all of it useful. If you do, great.

I am currently a Principal Engineer at a technology consultancy in Melbourne, Australia. Generally, opinions are my own and don't reflect those of my employer.

My current focus areas include:

* Full stack digital technologies
* Data Engineering and ML
* Cloud (AWS, Azure)
* DevOps, Systems of Work and Developer Ergonomics (not related to your chair height)
* System Architecture and Design
* Platforms
* Python, Golang, JVM languages
* Clean Code and Clean Architecture
