*Abstract*

Managing and containing complexity is one of the toughest challenges in designing and delivering IT systems of value in modern software engineering domains. But while any particular problem space carries "Inherent" complexity, differentiating between overall or global complexity, and that which is encountered in any given situation, can be instrumental in how long-lived, adaptable and scalable a platform can be in the long run.

Let's consider two models of complexity:

# Overall Complexity

When taken in totality
